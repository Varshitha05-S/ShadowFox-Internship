📄 Text Summarization using Transformer Models

✨ Overview
This project implements an AI-based text summarization system using a pre-trained Transformer model (BART). It generates short and meaningful summaries from long text inputs. This project is part of the Advanced Level Task of the ShadowFox Internship.

🎯 Objective
To reduce long text into concise summaries while preserving important information and demonstrating the use of modern NLP models.

🛠 Tools Used
• Python
• Google Colab
• Hugging Face Transformers
• BART Model
• Matplotlib

⚙ Methodology
The model takes a long paragraph as input and produces a clean summary. The results are evaluated using word count comparison and simple graphs.

📊 Evaluation & Results
✔ Reduced text length effectively
✔ Maintained key ideas
✔ Generated neat and readable summaries
✔ Visualized results using bar graphs

⚠ Limitations
• Fine details may be omitted
• Advanced evaluation metrics were not used

✅ Conclusion
This project shows how transformer-based models can be effectively used for text summarization, fulfilling the requirements of an Advanced NLP Internship Task.
